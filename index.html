          </header>
          <p>A much needed change is coming as this project (started in Sep 2013) is geting re-booted. You see, not much has been happening for the last 7 months, and with the Sprint/Summer term approaching it makes sense to try &Aacute; re-focus and get some momentum.</p>
          <p>Also, there's a bit of peripheral activity that may affect this project (more on that later). So, expect this site to change. I'm gathering my <a href="assortedThots.html">thots here</a>.</p>

<a name="housed-at-github" class="anchor" href="#housed-at-github"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Housed at GitHub.</h3>

<p>This project is housed at GitHub and owned/managed by <a href="https://github.com/dagilleland" class="user-mention">@dagilleland</a>. It has been birthed out of a perceived need for something like this for students and out of a desire to just improve my own programming skills and abilities.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors.</h3>

<p>At present, this project is open to contributors among people I know and/or work with. Right now, I've got about four people interested in helping out, but I might have room for about two or three more. As time goes on and requirements grow/change, I expect the list of contributors to change.</p>

<a name="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h4>

<p>Early in the life of this project, I ran across an online book titled <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001708">"Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET"</a>. <del>, and my hopes are this book will be a great resource for building the ASchool project. In fact, it is required reading for anyone planning on contributing to this project.</del></p>
