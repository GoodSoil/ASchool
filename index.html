<p>This project is housed at GitHub and owned/managed by <a href="https://github.com/dagilleland" class="user-mention">@dagilleland</a>. It has been birthed out of a perceived need for something like this for students and out of a desire to just improve my own programming skills and abilities.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors.</h3>

<p>At present, this project is open to contributors among people I know and/or work with. Right now, I've got about four people interested in helping out, but I might have room for about two or three more. As time goes on and requirements grow/change, I expect the list of contributors to change.</p>

<a name="expectations-of-contributors" class="anchor" href="#expectations-of-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Expectations of Contributors.</h4>

<p>Early in the life of this project, I ran across an online book titled <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001708">"Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET"</a>, and my hopes are this book will be a great resource for building the ASchool project. In fact, it is required reading for anyone planning on contributing to this project. :)</p>
