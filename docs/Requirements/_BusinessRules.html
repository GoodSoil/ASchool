    <h1>ASchool Business Rules - Idea Bucket</h1>
    <p>The business rules here are in "idea" format and exploratory. Once they are clearly worded and accompanied by an example (sample data), then they can be accepted and put into formal Acceptance Test format (Gherkin).</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">A note on writing Business Rules and Requirements. I&#39;ve read in a number of places how it&#39;s important to try and strip out language and terminology that has nothing to do specifically with the &quot;language domain&quot; of the business. For example, talking about &quot;when they click a button&quot; or &quot;then the database should&quot; is talking more about the technology rathern than the business. That kind of terminology might be good for narrow unit-tests that get into nitty-gritty internals, but all the &quot;big picture&quot; requirements should just stick to the business&#39; Language Domain.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>General</strong><ul>
            <li>All stories involve some kind of &quot;workflow&quot; - a way in which data moves from one state to another.</li>
            <li>Each &quot;workflow&quot; has its own set of rules</li>
            <li>Business rules can be shared among workflows within a given story.</li>
            <li>Business rules are not shared among different stories; by virtue of being in a different story, it represents a different rule by definition, because the story is the context for each business rule.</li>
            <li>Stories represent definable sets of data (tables/objects)<ul>
                <li>(? - uncertain) This data may participate in multiple stories in a read-only fashion and undergo [significant] editing in only one story (their primary story)</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The only acceptable course statuses are &quot;Proposed&quot;, &quot;Current&quot;, and &quot;Revision&quot;. These statuses are intended to represent a maintenance workflow.(Archiving a course involves removing it from the set of courses, but retaining the information for historical purposes.)

                                <li><span class="auto-style1">Proposed</span> - For new courses that are to be assigned a new course number (as opposed to a revision of a course that will be keeping its Course Number)</li>
                                <li><span class="auto-style1">Current</span> - For courses that are approved and complete in their information; Current courses are available for scheduling as an offering for any date after the Commencement Date and (if present) before the Completion Date</li>
                                <li><span class="auto-style1">Revision</span> - For existing courses that are undergoing a significant change, such as the number of credits, hours, semester, course dependencies, Academic path mapping, etc.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Course Dependencies<br />A course dependency occurs where two or more courses are expected to be taken in "sequence" or in "parallel". The courses form a type of <strong>Relationship</strong> and <strong>Connection</strong> to each other. A dependency chain is the complete linkage between courses (A→B↔C→D→E).<ul>
                    <li>The two types of Relationships possible between courses are <span class="auto-style1"><strong>Prerequisite</strong></span> and <span class="auto-style1"><strong>Corequisite</strong></span><ul>
                        <li>&quot;Prerequisite&quot; - (A &rarr; B) The courses are to be taken as a sequence, where one course must be completed <strong>before</strong> the other can be taken</li>
                        <li>&quot;Corequisite&quot; - (A &harr; B) The courses are to be taken in parallel, <strong>at the same time</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When describing pre-/co-requisites, the second course is said to &quot;depend upon&quot; the first course. In these examples, B depends upon A.<ul>
                        <li>A→B</li>
                        <li>A↔B</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Corequisite relationships are not necessarily &quot;bi-directional&quot;. Eg.:<ul>
                        <li>When stating that A↔B (that is, course B needs A), that does not mean that B↔A (course A needs B). Essentially, course A may stand independent of other courses, while B has a dependency</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Prerequisite courses cannot have a circular relationship. Eg: These are not allowed:<ul>
                        <li>A before B; B before A</li>
                        <li>A before B, B before C, C before A</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Corequisite courses can have a circular relationship. Eg: The following is allowed<ul>
                        <li>A at the same time as B, B at the same time as A</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Indirect circular relationships are not allowed. An indirect circular relationship occurs when prerequisite and corequisite relationships combine in a particular way.<br /><i>(Note: Dependency chains may be complex; care must be taken to ensure that indirect circular relationships are not created between courses. The best way to resolve a dependency chain for a circular dependency is to &quot;walk&quot; the dependencies for each course, looking for a duplicate)</i><ul>
                        <li>Eg: These are not allowed.<ul>
                            <li>A before B, B at the same time as C, C before A</li>
                            <li>A&rarr;B, B&harr;C, C&rarr;D, D&harr;A

                    Represents a mapping between a course and another course which can substitute as the equivalent in terms of earned credit. If a student has taken a course [CourseEquivalentID], then they can be automatically credited as having taken another (presumably) current course [CourseID].
                    If [CourseCreditID] is not null, then the equivalency is between two courses within our system/school. If the [CourseCreditID] is null, then the details of the equivalency is given in the CourseEquivalencyDetails table.
