ASchool
=======

ASchool is a system for managing courses and planning course selections for a self-registration system. It's also an exploration in handling (somewhat) complex course dependency and registration requirements.

The project page can be found at http://dagilleland.github.io/ASchool/

There are two permanent branches being maintained at the GitHub repository:
- master - the main branch for released versions
- develop - the branch used for the majority of development

Contributors are encouraged to create their own development branches in their local repository. We're just getting used to git and branches and team development, so the process we use will probably evolve. We're starting off with the approach by Vincent Driessen (see his blog post at http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), but we may look at doing something like the GitHub Flow (https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser).
