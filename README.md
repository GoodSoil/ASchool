ASchool
=======

ASchool is a system for managing courses and planning course selections for a self-registration system. It's also an exploration in handling (somewhat) complex course dependency and registration requirements.

The project page can be found at http://dagilleland.github.io/ASchool/

There are two permanent branches being maintained at the GitHub repository:
- master - the main branch for released versions
- develop - the branch used for the majority of development

This is based mainly on the deas of Vincent Driessen. To learn more about using branches to aid in development, see his blog post at http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
