### Project Mangement
Here's some good quotes:

http://www.smartsheet.com/blog/support-tip-milestones-in-project-management



"A milestone should not be about doing something: it should be about having arrived somewhere. It’s a place in the project that is unambiguous and clear to all in terms of what is meant when it has been achieved. Milestones, along with objectives, are an excellent way to identify misunderstandings before the project starts and eliminate those nasty surprises."
- Project Management Survival, pg. 68

"A milestone must be a speciﬁc, measurable, state of achievement within the project."
- ibid, pg.68
