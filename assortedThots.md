## Core Tenents
- A culture of
  - Learning - This project is all about growing our skills and knowlege.
  - Forgiveness - Making mistakes is part of learning, so the way we handle mistakes is important! Being able to "re-boot" after a mistake is important, so that lessons can be learned & we can move forward.

### Project Mangement
What I hope to achieve:
- A Complete End-to-End Project
  - Starting with a "Business PLan" - using http://leanstack.com
- Playing the role of "benevolent dictator" on the project, I hope to have a hand in most areas, but I also need to avoid any "micro-management" since this is supposed to be a community project.
Here's some good quotes:

"A milestone should not be about doing something: it should be about having arrived somewhere. It’s a place in the project that is unambiguous and clear to all in terms of what is meant when it has been achieved. Milestones, along with objectives, are an excellent way to identify misunderstandings before the project starts and eliminate those nasty surprises."
- Project Management Survival, pg. 68

"A milestone must be a speciﬁc, measurable, state of achievement within the project."
- ibid, pg.68
