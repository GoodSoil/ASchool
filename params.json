{"name":"Aschool","tagline":"ASchool is a system for managing courses and planning course selections for a self-registration system. It's also an exploration in handling (somewhat) complex course dependency and registration requirements.","body":"### Housed at GitHub.\r\nThis project is housed at GitHub and owned/managed by @dagilleland. It has been birthed out of a perceived need for something like this for students and out of a desire to just improve my own programming skills and abilities.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors.\r\nAt present, this project is open to contributors among people I know and/or work with. Right now, I've got about four people interested in helping out, but I might have room for about two or three more. As time goes on and requirements grow/change, I expect the list of contributors to change.\r\n\r\n#### Expectations of Contributors.\r\nEarly in the life of this project, I ran across an online book titled [\"Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET\"] (http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001708), and my hopes are this book will be a great resource for building the ASchool project. In fact, it is required reading for anyone planning on contributing to this project. :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
